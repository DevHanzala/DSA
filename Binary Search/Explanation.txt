=>Binary search element should be in montonic func (increasing/Decreasing order)

Steps To Find a key in Binary search:-
- take a avg of length of arr
-then cmp  key with mid point
-if yes return its index
-otherwise move forward/backward acc to val


Time Complexity:-
  (size)-n/2
      -n/4
          -n/8
              -n/2**k

n/2**k=1
n=2**k
k=logn

=>O(logn)

Q)Why Binaray Search?and How do we know about it?
=>Basically, when we neglect the left or right part by finding a possible/not possible solutions 
on a sorted answer search space.We can use Binaray Search.
