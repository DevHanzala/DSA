Linked List=>

It is a linear data structure, made with collection of nodes.

Node= |Data|next node address|
|2|add|-->|5|add|--->|67|add|-->null

why we need?
If I created an arr[10] and I wants to change it on run time so, how can I do?.
To counter this problem we have a linked list it's a dynamic data structure which can be grow/shrink on run time with out memory loss.
Insertion and deletion is easy no shift needed

Doubly Linked List:
  null<--|prev|data|next|--><--|prev|data|next|--><--|prev|data|next|-->null
