Insertion Sort=>


..Its same as like rounds as we saw previously in bubble sort (1)every rounds comparision,2) and insert an elements and i++,
 3)we recieved some sorted arr in every round with the help og right shift  not swaped,4)If we have n rounds so we will run just(n-1),
 5)Remembeered that we already assume our first elelment is already sorted.)
Question:[4,12,11,20]

=>    4-11-12-20

Question:[6,5,4,3,2,1,]

=>     1-2-3-4-5-6

..Why IS is Adaptable?
An adaptable sorting algorithm is one that can handle changes in the data during the sorting process.
Insertion sort is considered adaptable because it can efficiently insert new elements into the already sorted
portion of the array without needing to re-sort the entire array.

This makes it a suitable choice for scenarios where data is being added incrementally or where the 
data may change dynamically.

..why it is Stable?
Yes, insertion sort is also stable.
A stable sorting algorithm is one that preserves the relative order of elements with equal keys.
This means that if two elements have the same value, their relative order in the sorted array will
be the same as their relative order in the original array. Â  
Insertion sort maintains this property because it compares elements based on their values and inserts
them into the sorted portion of the array in a way that preserves their relative order.

Space Complexity=>
O(1)

Time Complexity=>
O(n**2)

Best Case(already sorted)
O(n)

Worst case(reverse sort)=>
O(n**2)
