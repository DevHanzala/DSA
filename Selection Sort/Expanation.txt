Seletion sort=>

what is?
We try diff round/passes and pick smallest element and placed on its right place

Example:

R1==> 64  25  12  22  11   i=0
R2==> 11  25  12  22  64   i=1
R3==> 11  12  25  22  64   i=2
R4==> 11  12  22  25  64   i=3

it means If we have a 5 value(n) so we need total Rounds that is =(n-1)

Complexity=>

Space Complexity:
O(1)  Because we don't take any extra space like not created any extra variables
Time Complexity:
O(n**2)  In Both Cases(Best/Worst)


Use Case:
When arr size is small


Stable Sort: Preserves the order of equal elements.
Unstable Sort: Does not preserve the order of equal elements
